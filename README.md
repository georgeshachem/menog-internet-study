The Middle East Network Operators Group (MENOG) brings together countries from two different continents: Africa and Asia. The Internet penetration rate in the MENOG region is 65.8% in 2019 against 54.5% for the rest of the world. [Annex 1] A number certainly above the world average but which nevertheless remains disappointing to compare with other regions or continents: namely, 95% in North America, 71.8% in South America and 85.2% in Europe.[1] Looking more closely, the Internet penetration rate does not seem really uniform in the different countries grouping the MENOG region. [Annex 1] In order to choose a field of study to better understand the Internet of the MENOG region, the following problem will be posed: What is the distribution of the inter-country delay in the MENOG region, and how is this impacted by topology and interconnection strategies?

## Objectives:
- Define the topology of the MENOG region
- Determine the use of intercontinental transit and peering in MENOG
- Conduct specific measurement and analysis in the MENOG region
- Analyze the distribution of inter-country delay
- Extract conclusions
